# PhysicsGPT Flow Laboratory System 🔬

## ✅ DELEGATION ISSUE FIXED! 

The **CrewAI Flows** implementation completely solves the delegation problem where only the Lab Director was working. Now all 10 specialists properly participate in every analysis.

## 🚀 What Changed

### ❌ Old System (Broken)
- **Hierarchical Process**: Lab Director gave generic responses without delegation
- **Single Task**: One task assigned to coordinator only
- **No Real Collaboration**: Specialists never actually worked

### ✅ New System (Working)
- **Event-Driven Flows**: Modern CrewAI Flows with @start/@listen decorators
- **Sequential Orchestration**: 8 flow steps with proper handoffs
- **All Specialists Active**: Every agent contributes specialized expertise
